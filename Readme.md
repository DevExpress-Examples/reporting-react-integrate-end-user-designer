# Reporting for React - How to Integrate the Report Designer in React App

This example shows how to incorporate the Web Report Designer into a client-side app built with React. The example consists of two parts:

- A server (back-end)Â ASP.NET Core project that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements a custom web report storage.

- A React front-end client application.

Perform the following steps to run this example:

1. Open the back-end project solution (*ServerSideApp/ServerSideApp.sln*) in Visual Studio and run the project.
2. Navigate to the *react-report-designer* folder that is the client part's root folder.
3. Open the console and run the following command:

    ```npm install```

4. Run the command to compile and start the client part:

    ```npm start```

5. The client application opens the browser at http://localhost:3000/. It displays the **Report Designer** with the **TestReport** report.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that the backend application runs on the port specified in the host setting of the Report Designer component. For more information, refer to the following help topic: [Determine the Host URL](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400196/web-reporting/asp-net-core-reporting/server-side-configuration/report-designer-server-side-configuration-asp-net-core#step-3-determine-the-host-url).
