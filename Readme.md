# Reporting for React - Add a Web Report Designer to a React App

This example incorporates the Web Report Designer into a client-side app built with React. The example consists of two parts:

- The [ServerSideApp](ServerSideApp) folder contains the backend project. The project is anÂ ASP.NET Core application that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements custom web report storage.


- The [react-report-designer](react-report-designer) folder contains the client application built with React.

## Quick Start

### Server

In the *ServerSideApp/ServerSideApp* folder, run the following command:


```
dotnet run
```

The server starts at http://localhost:5000. To debug the server, run the application in Visual Studio.

### Client

In the *react-report-designer* folder, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to view the result. The application displays the Web Report Designer.

## Customization Examples

This project contains code snippets used for client-side customization and reflected in our online help topics. Each code snippet is enclosed in a `page.tsx` file in a separate folder. After running the project, navigate the following locations to see the result:

| Location | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /client-side-api | Performs some client-side actions.
| /save-modified-report | Saves a modified report in the currently active tab. Saves all modified reports. | 
| /manage-properties-panel | Hides or disables individual editors or sections in the **Properties panel** for the specified control type. |
| /report-designer-api | Calls the Report Designer's `RunWizard` method to invoke New Report Wizard. |
| /open-report | Adds a button that loads a specified report. |
