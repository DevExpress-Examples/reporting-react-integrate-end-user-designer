# Reporting for React - Add a Web Report Designer to a React App

This example incorporates the Web Report Designer into a client-side app built with React. The example consists of two parts:

- The [ServerSideApp](ServerSideApp) folder contains the backend project. The project is anÂ ASP.NET Core application that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements custom web report storage.


- The [react-report-designer](react-report-designer) folder contains the client application built with React.

## Quick Start

### Server

In the *ServerSideApp* folder, run the following command:


```
dotnet run
```

The server starts at http://localhost:5000. To debug the server, run the application in Visual Studio.

### Client

In the *react-report-designer* folder, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to view the result. The application displays the Web Report Designer.
